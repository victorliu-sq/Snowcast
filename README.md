Snowcast is an Internet Radio Broadcasting Station designed by CSCI1680 stuff in Brown University for students to implement socket programming, systems programming and building concurrent applications from scratch. The whole system is 1200 lines of Go.

# Initialize

server

```shell
./snowcast_server 8888 ./mp3/Beethoven-SymphonyNo5.mp3 ./mp3/DukeEllington-Caravan.mp3 ./mp3/FX-Impact193.mp3
```



client1

```shell
./snowcast_control localhost 8888 5000
```

listener1

```shell
./snowcast_listener 5000 | pv > /dev/null
```



# Add another pair of client&listener

client2

```shell
./snowcast_control localhost 8888 6000
```

listener2

```shell
./snowcast_listener 6000 | pv > /dev/null
```



# Operation

```shell
# client2
2
# client1
0
# server
p
# client1
1
# server
p
p out
```



# Extra credit

All of them are on the side of server

Test of adding a file (which will start a Daeome to iterate chunks in a file)

```shell
# not enough chars
a 
# filename does not exist in folder
a NonExistedFile.mp3
# filename exists in the server
a ./mp3/Beethoven-SymphonyNo5.mp3
# valid filename
p
a ./mp3/ManchurianCandidates-Breakin.mp3
p
```



Test of removing a file (which will stop a Daeome to iterate chunks in a file)

```shell
# not enough chars
r 
# stationIdx is out of range
r 3
# stationIdx exists in the server
r 0
```
